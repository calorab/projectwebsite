            <p>Hi! I am Caleb Gammon, a web developer located just north of Atlanta. When I'm not in front of my computer you can find me jogging with my 2 pitbull-mixes, Netflixing with my wife or out at a concert. What makes me a good web developer is my voracious appetite to learn everything I can, my ability to focus on the issue in front of me for long periods and (let me be honest here) all the mistakes i've learned from in the past. Click on projects to see my past Projects or Email to get in touch - I look forward to speaking with you.</p>

            <h4>More about me...</h4>
            <p>Being a big sci-fi fan, programming has always held this magnetic interest for me. Climbing up that mountain to reach the lofty summit of "Developer" was something I've wanted to do for years. Once I married my wife and got settled in, I quickly started thinking of our future and where we wanted to go. Sales, the only job I had really known since college, seemed to be fine for some - but not for me. I wanted to have a career that I could be proud of. I wanted to build something. I wanted to grow. And I wanted to be a part of a team!</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>From there I researched programs to join and talked to many organizations. Ultimately I went with Thinkful for a few reasons. First they had a program that I could fit into my current daily schedule - work, family and "life" had to go on while I changed careers. Secondly, their approach was to provide you the course and pair you with a mentor rather than have you sit in classroom-style learning environments. Knowing that educational transfer and retention is a common issue in standard learning environments I wanted to get into a situation where I was limiting that downside and also getting to pick the brain of a dedicated mentor on all things javascript/react/Node/career. Lastly I wanted to build the actual skills related to the career I wanted. The crriculum is designed to resemble documentation, which I have learned (time and time again) is something I would be using often in my WebDev career.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Once in the course I did find myself having issues getting a handle on everything I needed to know. Understanding the "macro" of how all the parts fit together and what went where was something I lacked. I decided to take a break and find what I was missing - forms of visual learning. Once I saw what I had learned put into context on the screen, and practiced further, everything clicked into place. From there, knowing that basic computer science literacy was imperative, I found classes for that as well - adding knowledge of the intricate processes that boil software and algorythms down into 1's and 0's to my web-based education thus far.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>In the end my journey took longer than I would have liked. However, because of that extra time I was able to create a much more solid understanding of the details as well as the global environment of web development. I also was able to make far more mistakes, and learn from them; which is nothing but good for a beginning WebDev engineer. And through all the ups and down I learned how to learn again, what habits I need to develope, where to look for answers to tough problems, how to debug my code, the importance of learning your IDE, when to ask for help, and much, much more that was not in any curriculum!</p>
