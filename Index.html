            <p>Hi! I am Caleb Gammon, a web developer located in Atlanta. When I'm not in front of my computer you can find me jogging with my 2 pitbull-mixes, Netflixing with my wife or out at a concert. What makes me a good Web Developer is my voracious appetite to learn everything I can, my ability to focus on the issue in front of me for long periods and the excitement that drives me to love programming more and more every day! I am currently job searching and I look forward to speaking with you.</p>

            <h3>More about me...</h3>
            <p>Being a big sci-fi fan, programming has always held a magnetic interest for me. Once I married my wife and got settled in, I quickly started thinking of our future and where we wanted to go. I wanted to have a career that I could be proud of. I wanted to build something. I wanted to grow. And I wanted to feel like I was part of a team!</p>
            <p>From there I researched programs to join and talked to many organizations. Ultimately I went with Thinkful for a many reasons - primarily because their approach was to provide access to the course and pair you with a dedicated mentor rather than have you sit in classroom-style learning environments. Knowing that educational transfer and retention is a common issue in standard learning environments I wanted to get into a situation where I was limiting that downside and also getting to pick the brain of a dedicated mentor on all things Web Development and Career.</p>
            <p>Once in the course I did find myself having issues getting a handle on how everything I was learning fit together. To solve this problem I decided to take a break and find what I was missing - forms of visual learning. Once I saw what I had learned put into context on the screen, and practiced further, everything clicked into place. From there, I learned about basic computer science - adding knowledge of the processes that boil algorythms down into 1's and 0's to my web-based education thus far.</p>
            <p>In the end my journey took longer than I would have liked. However, because of that extra time I was able to build a solid WebDev foundation, as well as learn what habits I need to develope, where to look for answers to tough problems, how to debug my code, the importance of learning my IDE, when to ask for help, and much, much more!</p>
            <div class="thanks">
                    <p>Thanks for your time, and if you have read this far I hope you will take just 2 more minutes to either <strong>send me an email at calebwgammon@gmail.com</strong> or get in touch via LinkedIn.</p>
