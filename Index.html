            <p>Hi! I am Caleb Gammon, a web developer located in Atlanta looking to leverage my obsession to learn everything I can, my analytical mind and decade-plus in communication experience to join an exciting development team. I am actively job searching and hope to have the opportunity to show you the value I can bring to your organization through my hard work and problem-solving skills.</p>

        <section class="mystory">
            <p>When I'm not in front of my computer you can find me jogging with my 2 pitbull-mixes, playing Mario Kart with my wife or out at a concert. I love problem-solving and like to solve many types of puzzles in my down time. I also play chess, raising my FIDE score from 900 to just under 1400 in the last few months - which I'm very proud of. I dove headfirst into web development because I wanted to have a career that I could be proud of, I wanted to build something real and I wanted to challeng myself!</p>
            <p>Education:</p>
            <ul class="edu-list">
                <li>B.A in Business Management - North Georgia University</li>
                <li>Thinkful FullStack Engineering-Flex coding program (Currently completing)</li>
                <li>React The Complete Guide - Academind (via Udemy)</li>
                <li>Node.js The Complete Guide - Academind (via Udemy)</li>
                <li>MongoDB The Complete Developer's Guide 2020 - Academind (via Udemy)</li>
                <li>CS50 AP Computer Science - Harvard Online Course (via EDX)</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- <p>When I started researching Web development programs to join I talked to many organizations, but ultimately I went with Thinkful because their approach was to pair students with a dedicated mentor rather than have you sit in classroom-style learning environments. Once in the course I found myself having issues with the online curriculum. Additionally with life getting very busy I needed to take a break from the program. </p>
            <p>In the end my journey has taken longer than I would have liked. However, because of that extra time I have been able to build a solid development foundation, as well as learn what habits I need to develop, how to problem-solve, how to debug my code, when to ask for help, and much, much more!</p> -->
            <div class="thanks">
                    <p>Thanks for your time, and if you have read this far I hope you will take just 2 more minutes to either <strong>send me an email at calebwgammon@gmail.com</strong> or get in touch via LinkedIn.</p>
