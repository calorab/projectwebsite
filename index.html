            <p>Hi! I am Caleb Gammon, a web developer located in Atlanta looking to leverage my obsession to learn everything I can, my analytical mind and decade-plus in communication experience to join an exciting development team. I am actively job searching and hope to have the opportunity to show you the value I can bring to your organization through my hard work and problem-solving skills.</p>
            <p>When I'm not in front of my computer you can find me jogging with my 2 pitbull-mixes, playing Mario Kart with my wife or out at a concert. I love problem-solving and like to solve many types of puzzles in my down time. I also play chess, raising my FIDE score from 900 to just under 1400 in the last few months - which I'm very proud of. I dove headfirst into web development because I want to have a career that I could be proud of, I want to build something important and I want to challeng myself!</p>
