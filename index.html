            <p>Hi! I am Caleb Gammon, a Customer Success Engineer located in Atlanta. I have found a niche bridging the
                gap between developers and users. I combine soft skills from well over a decade in Relationship
                Management and client-facing roles with hands-on experience using cloud infrastructure like Snowflake,

                to companies and clients alike!</p>
